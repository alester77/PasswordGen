# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
I created this password generator to make secure passwords. It gives the option of adding lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  

## Usage
Open webpage. Click "Generate Password" button. Chose a number between 8 and 128 characters. Click Ok to include lower case letters. Cancel to say no. Same for uppercase, numbers and special characters. A password will be displayed. 

## Credits
